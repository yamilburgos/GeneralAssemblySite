# Homework: GA Press Release!! ðŸ“°

Now that we've learned an awesome amount of CSS, it's time to put it all together. For this homework you'll be writing your own HTML and CSS to create a press release for General Assembly.

### You'll need to:
- Attach the stylesheet `style.css` to `index.html`
- Write the HTML for the page, using the content in `content.txt`, and style it!!!
    - Use at least one pseudo-class or pseudo-element!!!
    - Write a media query for desktop and make sure it's adaptive to different screen sizes!
    - Optional: use a [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) or two!
- Deploy it on GitHub pages.
